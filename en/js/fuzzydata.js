That all sounds great! But there are lots of cool buzzwords and jargon that don’t totally make sense. So, what exactly does this all mean? What is this AI? How does it work? Why would I want to use Sofia GPT? And, most importantly, how can it help me? Let me break it down for you so that by the end of this video you understand how Sofia GPT works and how Sofia GPT can work for you. " },

"body" : "Let’s begin by breaking down the statement “Sofia GPT is an advanced Azure OpenAI GPT module developed by OnePlan.” Azure  is a cloud computing platform operated by Microsoft that provides access, management, and development of applications and services via globally distributed data centers. OpenAI  is an AI research group responsible for the creation of the popular AI models GPT (language-based generative AI), and DALL-E (image-based generative AI). GPT is short for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer.” “Generative” means that the AI model can create new data based on patterns that it has learned from its training data. “Pre-trained” means that the model has already been optimized based on this source data, meaning that it does not need to check back against its original training data every time it is prompted. So, it is a lot faster and more powerful than older AI models. And “Transformer” is a powerful type of neural network algorithm specialized in learning relationships between long strings of data, like sentences and paragraphs. In simpler terms, the GPT models are very good pattern identifiers and replicators. The GPT model AIs have been trained on huge quantities of human language. The AIs then learn common patterns between words in those datasets, and in doing so, become very good at reproducing human language. So, OnePlan developed Sofia GPT as a customized chatbot app that utilizes OpenAI’s GPT AI model. All of this is then hosted in Azure (Microsoft) data centers and integrates seamlessly with OnePlan technology. The Sofia GPT module is particularly useful for OnePlan users because it can leverage data not only from OpenAI’s network of data sources but from OnePlan itself. This makes Sofia GPT much different from other AI helpers found in PPM tools. Typically, the AI helpers are not able to access the data in the PPM tool, and so the analysis the AI is able to provide is limited to external data sources. Sofia GPT, however, can analyze data right from your OnePlan environment and provide a customized analysis that is relevant to you, your team, and your business. " },

From this drop-down, you can access all of your current and historical status reports. In this example, the status report for 1\/25\/2024 is Pending and needs to be reviewed, updated, and submitted. Basically what OnePlan does is it generates a status report based on the current data in your plan. What’s nice about this is that you can come into your pending status report and make modifications before submitting it. Any changes that you make in the status report will also be reflected in the plan itself, so your data is accurate across the board. You can edit any editable field in the status report. So, for this example, I may need to update the Status Health of my plan before I submit this report. I can simply click into the Status Health field, and select the correct value. This updated Status Health value will also be reflected in the live plan as well. Perhaps I need to update the Forecast value in this status report. I can click into the Forecast field and update this value. Again, this value will also be updated in the plan itself. Finally, maybe I would like to add some Additional Comments into the status report, I can enter those comments into the Additional Comments field, and those comments will be tracked as your plan progresses and future status reports are generated.

"body" : "An example use case for using Financial Plans in OnePlan might be for a CFO or finance manager overseeing several projects. They could create a financial plan for each project, outlining the expected costs, allocated budget, and revenue forecasts. For instance, if a company is planning a product launch, the Financial Plan will include the costs of product development, marketing, and production, as well as expected revenue from product sales. Or in a construction project, it can be used to track costs of labor, materials, permits, etc against the budget set for the project. By regularly updating the Financial Plans with actual costs and revenues as the project progresses, they can keep a close watch on the financial health of each project. OnePlan's financial planning tools can help identify if costs are running over budget or if revenues are lower than expected, enabling timely decision-making and strategic adjustments. " },
